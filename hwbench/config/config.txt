runtime:
   role : defines the number of seconds a test runs
   value: integer: x
   unit : seconds

monitor:
   role : defines what environement metrics should be monitored during jobs
   value: thermal, power, fans
   unit : text
   note : components/platforms in hwbench will have to implement them so its stay generic in the config file

engine:
    role : name of the benchmark engine in hwbench
    value: any of the supported engine coded in hwbench
    unit : text

engine_module:
    role : a testing mode from the benchmark
    value: depends of the benchmark tool but also hwbench implementation
    unit : text
    note : if not defined, equals engine name

engine_module_parameter:
    role : input parameter of the engine_module
    value: any input accepted by the engine_module
           list: x,y,z
    unit : text
    note : if not defined, equals engine_module name

hosting_cpu_cores:
    role : list the logical cpu cores eligible during the test
    value: integer: x
           range: x-y
           list: x,y,z
    unit : integer
    note : if omitted, all cores are selected
           special keywords :
                quadran_<x>: selects the <x>th cpu quandrant of the CPU (AMD)
                numa_<x>   : selects the <x>th NUMA node of the system
                all        : all cores are selected (default)
                list       : items in hosting_cpu_cores list are considered separately


hosting_cpu_cores_scaling:
    role : defines how the hosting_cpu_cores is consumed
    value: plus_<x> : <x> cores are added to the pinning
           iterate  : for each value of hosting_cpu_cores, a new sub job is executed
                      if hosting_cpu_cores has lower cpu count than stressor_range, the list is looped
           none     : all hosting_cpu_cores cores are available for each job
    unit : text
    note : if hosting_cpu_cores is an integer, hosting_cpu_cores_scaling is not considered

stressor_range:
    role : list the number of stressor threads to use during this test
    value: integer: x
           range: x-y
           list: x,y,z
    unit : integer
    note : if omitted, stressor_range = hosting_cpu_cores
           special keywords :
                all        : all hosting_cpu_cores are selected (default)

stressor_range_scaling:
    role : defines how the stressor_range is consumed
    value: plus_<x>: x stressor is added at each run
           pow2    : stressors are doubled at each runtime
           max     : all stressors are runs at the same time, not scaling is performed (default)
    unit : text
    note : if stressor_range is an integer, stressor_range_scaling is not considered
           if omitted, no scaling is performed
           special keywords:
                list: items in stressor_range list are considered separately

thermal_start:
    role : defines when the jobs are authorized to start
    value: list: <item>:<temp_in_celsius>, <item2>:<temp_in_celsius>
    unit : text
    note : if not listed, jobs can starts immediately

fans_start:
    role : defines when the jobs are authorized to start
    value: list: <item>:<fan_speed>, <item2>:<fan_speed>
    unit : text
    note : if not listed, jobs can starts immediately
           fan_speed can be expressed in % or rpm
